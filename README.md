# WuzzleRush

[WuzzleRush](https://wuzzlerush.brndndiaz.dev) is a fast-paced, multiplayer word puzzle game built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [InstantDB](https://instantdb.com/). Challenge your friends in real-time lobbies, solve word puzzles, and climb the leaderboard!

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer lobbies (host or join games)
- Customizable game settings (rounds, time limit, difficulty, etc.)
- Audio and music controls
- Modern, animated UI with support for mobile and web
- Built-in word lists and puzzle generator
- Cross-platform: iOS, Android, and Web

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can then run the app on:

- iOS Simulator
- Android Emulator
- Physical device (via QR code)
- Web browser

### 3. Project Structure

- `app/` — Main app screens and navigation (file-based routing)
- `components/` — Reusable UI and screen components
- `lib/` — Game logic, state management, and InstantDB integration
- `utils/` — Utility functions and word lists
- `assets/` — Fonts, images, and audio
- `ios/` and `android/` — Native project files (autogenerated by Expo)

## Development

- Edit files in `app/` and `components/` to add or update screens and UI.
- Use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to launch the app directly in a simulator/emulator.
- Use `npm run web` to run the app in your browser.
- Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues.

## Resetting the Project

To reset the project to a blank state (for starting fresh):

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move your current code to `/app-example` and create a new blank `/app` directory.
